Innovative Idea:
Our project idea is to make a courses assessment website which allows students to assess each course in UMass (or even other universities) based on how hard it is, how much time it takes per week and how interesting it is. Therefore, users can enter data or retrieve sorted data on this website to see if this is an easy course or a hard one, an interesting course or not. There's a website called RateMyProfessor, but our application is quite different from RateMyProfessor as it is mainly based on ratings of a professor but our application focused on each course. It will also provide a simple and effective user interface which can make users understand how they can do the searches quickly.

Important Components:
Each course will have attributes of which university and which section(differed by different professors), and students will evaluate the hardness, average time taken and level of interest(maybe we will add more) of the selected course. Therefore, college students will have a better option for selecting courses based on their own situation. For example, if a student’s GPA is less satisfactory and he wants to raise his GPA a little bit, he can rank down the courses with a hard level and choose an easy course which he is interested in. If a student can’t decide which course is more interesting and useful, so he doesn’t know how to decide, he can also do the same on this website to see the comments and evaluations left by the students who have finished the course and then make his decision.

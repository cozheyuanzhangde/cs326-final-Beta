## App Name: Find Ur Course!
### Semester: Fall 2020
### Overview:
This app is created for students who want to find their desired courses. Students can search/comment/add courses and rank them by difficulty, time consumption, and overall. I think our app is innovative because many students are struggling to find the most suitable course for themselves. Some students want challenging courses while some students want easy courses for giving their GPA a little boost. In the same course, different instructor will have many differences and students may want to choose based on their preferences. Also, findurcourse is based on courses and sections but not professors.
